# 🧠 Autism Detector

An AI-powered web application that helps in detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tendencies using **machine learning** and **deep learning** models.  

This project leverages **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models** to identify behavioral patterns associated with autism. The app is deployed as an interactive web interface for easy accessibility.
